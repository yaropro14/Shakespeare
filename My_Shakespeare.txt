A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
And makes himself an artificial night:
And makes himself an artificial night:
And private in his chamber pens himself,
And private in his chamber pens himself,
And stole into the covert of the wood:
And the continuance of their parents' rage,
As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
Black and portentous must this humour prove,
Black and portentous must this humour prove,
Both by myself and many other friends:
Both by myself and many other friends:
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
But he, his own affections' counsellor,
But he, his own affections' counsellor,
But to himself so secret and so close,
But to himself so secret and so close,
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.
Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
I, measuring his affections by my own,
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
Is to himself--I will not say how true--
Is to himself--I will not say how true--
Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
Many a morning hath he there been seen,
Many a morning hath he there been seen,
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
Should in the furthest east begin to draw
Should in the furthest east begin to draw
Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
So early walking did I see your son:
So far from sounding and discovery,
So far from sounding and discovery,
That most are busied when they're most alone,
That westward rooteth from the city's side,
The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
The which if you with patient ears attend,
Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
Two households, both alike in dignity,
Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
We would as willingly give cure as know.
We would as willingly give cure as know.See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.

Two households, both alike in dignity,
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
And the continuance of their parents' rage,
Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
The which if you with patient ears attend,
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
That westward rooteth from the city's side,
So early walking did I see your son:
Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
And stole into the covert of the wood:
I, measuring his affections by my own,
That most are busied when they're most alone,
Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
Many a morning hath he there been seen,
With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
Should in the furthest east begin to draw
The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
And private in his chamber pens himself,
Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
And makes himself an artificial night:
Black and portentous must this humour prove,
Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
Both by myself and many other friends:
But he, his own affections' counsellor,
Is to himself--I will not say how true--
But to himself so secret and so close,
So far from sounding and discovery,
As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.
We would as willingly give cure as know.
Many a morning hath he there been seen,
With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
Should in the furthest east begin to draw
The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
And private in his chamber pens himself,
Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
And makes himself an artificial night:
Black and portentous must this humour prove,
Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
Both by myself and many other friends:
But he, his own affections' counsellor,
Is to himself--I will not say how true--
But to himself so secret and so close,
So far from sounding and discovery,
As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.
We would as willingly give cure as know.See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
